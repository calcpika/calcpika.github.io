=====
heyo! i'm calcoholic (he/him), a mathematics and computer science engineering undergraduate at the university of california, los angeles (ucla). i was initially admitted as an applied mathematics student before adding on another major. i find mathematics the most eloquent study any human can dedicate their lifetime to, however, while there exists a charm in the discipline, i found mathematics to not fulfill several of my interests. in particular, addressing humanity. i chose applied mathematics as my initial field of study because i enjoyed (more than its purity) its whimsy in geometry, patterns and combinatorics. i would spend hours thinking about famous conjectures like collatz and strong goldbach (without making any progress, obviously). coming into ucla, i realized the world is greater than the prettiness of mathematics; there are real issues that challenge humanity, many of which i would like to at least partially contribute to alleviate. thus was born the computer science engineering double major. i have no interests in being a regular software engineer, i would like to learn how i can create technologies that address the human within us. 

the first of this is a class in neural signal processing & brain-computer interfaces. i am not very good at biology, but i hope this becomes false by the end of this year. 

anyway, enough with the academics! i like listening to rock and metal music. i am trying to become good at rock climbing and i love backpacking to national forests! i am also very good at sudoku (but that's more math i suppose...)
