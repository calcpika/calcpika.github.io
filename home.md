# welcome to calcpika's topological space

in this space, you will be able to explore my short website with a fun twist (i hope) to some of the things that i like. you can find the music i listen to, some books i have been reading, my personal interests and other random things. i have another website (more professional than whatever this is) but for the sake of anonymity, it shall not be disclosed :D (unless you're able to find it, good luck!)
